# Welcome to the Blog Aggregator

We're going to build an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed aggregator in Go! We'll call it "Gator", you know, because aggreGATOR üêä. Anyhow, it's a CLI tool that allows users to:

- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post
- Browse your collected posts with an optional limit parameter

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to integrate a Go application with a PostgreSQL database
- Practice using your SQL skills to query and migrate a database (using [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) and [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose), two lightweight tools for typesafe SQL in Go)
- Learn how to write a long-running service that continuously fetches new posts from RSS feeds and stores them in the database

## Available Commands

### User Management

- `gator register <username>` - Register a new user
